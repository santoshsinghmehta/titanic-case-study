We all know about the Titanic disaster. The ship collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest disasters in modern history.

Scientists have collected data for a fraction of total passengers and marked if they survived the disaster or not. You can access it here-: https://gist.github.com/avmain/284b549eabc13061ce2b0b58b163c7f9.

Provided the details of a new passenger your task is to study the dataset and design a Machine Learning model to classify, if the passenger survived the disaster or not.
